                            <p>  Our Secretariat team has been hard at work teaching at meetings, designing logos and merchandise, managing club finances, and maintaing our club's social media accounts and websites. Thank you to our Head Secretary, our Secretaries of Outreach and Recruitment, our Secretary of Finance, and most importantly our Co-Presidents for devoting time and effort into our MUN Club. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us. We hope to see you at our meetings!</p>

                            <p>Ayaan Jeraj</p><br>
                            <p>Ayaan Jeraj is overjoyed to be serving as the President of the Prince of Wales Model United Nations Club. Ayaan is passionate about debating, public speaking and world issues. Since attending his first conference in 2018, he remains passionate about Model United Nations. When Ayaan is not preparing for Model UN conferences, writing opening statements or organising MUN meetings, he listens to jazz, classical, and pop music. Ayaan enjoys playing the piano and the saxophone. He is an avid soccer and golf player and enjoys running. Ayaan is eager to work with all PWMUNC members and is excited to build up the clubâ€™s membership, participation and attendance at more MUN conferences.</p>

                            <p>Ryan Li</p><br>
                            <p> Our Head Secretary and Secretary of Meetings and Planning, Ryan enjoys playing sports such as football and basketball with friends. He also enjoys debating with others about current issues, especially politics, frequently having clashing points of view with others, resulting in very insightful discussions. When he's not debating with his friends, you can find Ryan reading random facts about random things to cure his boredom. Ryan started doing Model UN last year in May, as a result of quarantine boredom, and it has quickly become one of his passions. Since then, he has attended 3 conferences, being PWVMUN, VYMUN, and VMUN, frequently winning awards. His highlight of his MUN career so far has been roasting his fellow exec team member, Ayaan, in question period in the House of Commons committee at VMUN this past January.</p>

                            <p>Penelope, along with Navya, run the PWMUNC Instagram account, posting content such as facts about MUN, meeting reminders and much more!  She joined Model UN to improve her public speaking and debating skills, and thoroughly enjoys her experience.  The best part of MUN is the conferences of course!  Engaging in debate and compromising to pass resolution papers is a highlight along with meeting lots of new people. In her spare time, Penelope plays volleyball, piano, and enjoys baking and reading.</p>
