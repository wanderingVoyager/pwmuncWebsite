        Join the Prince of Wales Model United Nations Club (PWMUNC)!
If you are interested in debating, public speaking, writing, problem solving, and discussing world issues this is the club for you! Model UN gives you the opportunity to represent a countryâ€™s views on the world stage with the goal of creating global solutions. Although this may seem very daunting, throughout the year we will focus on preparing and training students to excel in Model United Nations Conferences. Our goal is to meet a couple times during each month to practice our skills and to attend a few virtual conferences during the year. If you have any questions or are interested in joining the club, please contact our Executive Team.
